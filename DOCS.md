# Project Documentation

Welcome to the documentation for the <Your Project Name> web application! This guide will walk you through the steps to set up and run the application locally.

## Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure you have the following installed on your machine:

- [Java](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html) (JDK 8 or later)
- [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi)
- [Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli) (for Azure deployment)

## Running Locally

Follow these steps to run the application locally:

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git
   ```

2. **Build the Project:**
   ```bash
   cd your-repository
   ./mvnw clean install
   ```

3. **Create an Executable JAR:**
   ```bash
   ./mvnw package
   ```

4. **Run the Application:**
   ```bash
   java -jar target/your-app-name.jar
   ```

   The application will start on [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).

5. **Access the Application:**
   Open your web browser and go to [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) to view the application.

## Azure Deployment (Optional)

If you want to deploy the application to Azure App Service, follow these additional steps:

1. **Install Azure CLI:**
   Follow the instructions [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli) to install the Azure CLI.

2. **Log in to Azure:**
   ```bash
   az login
   ```

3. **Deploy to Azure App Service:**
   ```bash
   az webapp up --name your-app-name --sku F1 --location your-region
   ```

   Replace `your-app-name` with a unique name for your app, and `your-region` with your desired Azure region.

4. **Access the Deployed Application:**
   After deployment, Azure will provide you with a URL to access your deployed Spring Boot application.

## Additional Configuration

- **Database Configuration (if applicable):**
  Configure the database connection in the `application.properties` or `application.yml` file.

- **SSL Configuration (Optional):**
  If you want to enable HTTPS, configure SSL. Azure App Service provides options for managing SSL certificates.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues or have questions, please refer to the [official documentation](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/getting-started.html) or feel free to open an issue on our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/your-username/your-repository/issues).

Happy coding!
### This project is not currently deployed on Azure, but it will be soon. The frontend has already been deployed on Netlify.

Replace `<Your Project Name>`, `your-username`, `your-repository`, `your-app-name`, and `your-region` with your actual project details. This document provides a basic set of instructions to help users run your Spring Boot application locally and, optionally, deploy it to Azure. Feel free to customize it based on your project's specific requirements.
