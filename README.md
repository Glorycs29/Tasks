# To-Do List Web App

## Overview

The To-Do List Web App is a task management application designed to help users organize and prioritize their daily tasks efficiently. The project utilizes a full-stack approach with React.js for the frontend, Java with Spring Boot for the backend, and MySQL for the database.

## Architecture

The application follows a modular architecture with distinct layers for the frontend, backend, and database.

- **Frontend (React.js):** Handles the user interface and interacts with the backend through RESTful APIs.
- **Backend (Java with Spring Boot):** Manages business logic, API endpoints, and communicates with the database.
- **Database (MySQL):** Stores task data with a relational database schema.
